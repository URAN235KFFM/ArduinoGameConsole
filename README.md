# ArduinoGameConsole
A minimal solution to create audio and video with an Arduino Nano

I wanted to build a game console into the case of a small USB game pad (a NES look-alike).
To make the work a challenge, I wanted to only use an Arduino Nano and some passive 
components (diodes are OK) and create the best possible video and audio signal that is
imaginable with such restrictions.

I guess that a monochrome 288p video signal with 4 gray scales is possible when 
progamming the controller at machine level. Multi-channel auto could also be done.

My game of choice is Tetris in a version that should come close to the original 
GameBoy version, with a nice audio track as well.
